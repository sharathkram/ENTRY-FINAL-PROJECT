Project Title:AI Tool Usage Among Indian College Students: Adoption and Impact Study

 Project Overview:
 Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, and AI-based learning platforms are increasingly used by college students across India.However, there is limited empirical research that systematically analyzes how Indian college students are adopting these tools, what drives their usage, and how students perceive their effectiveness and ethical implications. This study seeks to explore the patterns of AI tool usage, examine the correlation with academic performance, and identify key factors influencing satisfaction and trust in AI tools among Indian college students.

 Key aspects include:
