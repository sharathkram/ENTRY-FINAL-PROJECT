Problem Statement


Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, and AI-based learning platforms are increasingly used by college students across India. However, there is limited empirical research that systematically analyzes how Indian college students are adopting these tools, what drives their usage, and how students perceive their effectiveness and ethical implications. This study seeks to explore the patterns of AI tool usage, examine the correlation with academic performance, and identify key factors influencing satisfaction and trust in AI tools among Indian college students.

This study seeks to develop an India-focused, evidence-based understanding of AI adoption among college students and to quantify its educational impact. Specifically, it aims to characterize usage behaviors, examine associations with academic outcomes, and identify the factors that shape satisfaction, trust, and responsible use.




Key aspects include:

	Analyse the usage of AI by different level of students
	Handle missing values, inconsistent formats.
	Use graphs and summaries to communicate findings clearly.


Goal—To understand the level usage AI tools in education

Project Objectives:

	Analyse the insights from the dataset using different functionality
	To understand the growth of AI in the education sector.
	Simplify data using different visualization tools
	To provide insight on AI growth and its trust among students


Scope of the Project:

	Data Loading and Preliminary Analysis.
	Data Cleaning
	Exploratory Data Analysis
	Visualizations
	Reports, Insights, Conclusion

Tools and Technologies Used:


	Python – Core programming language for data processing and analysis.
	Pandas – For data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation.
	Matplotlib-- For creating basic plots
	Seaborn- For advanced and visually appealing plots
	CSV File Format – Data source stored and processed in CSV format.


Key Insights and Summary

	Most of the students use AI tools for 1 to 3 hours 
	Tools like Chat GPT, Grammarly, and Gemini are more preferred 
	Streams like CS/IT show higher average usage than others.
	Year-wise usage indicates the tech adoption increases in the later years.
	Device preference impacts usage -laptop shows higher average hours.
	Recommendations- AI tool workshops can be tailored by stream/year
